To use Vim with YouCompleteMe, using a pre-built version for now

For the OmniSharp for cs files, need to open the project with Visual Studio, and compile
```
ycm_folder/python/ycm/completers/cs/OmniSharpServer/OmniSharp.sln
```

Better use chocolatey python, the one in scoop can't be found by this vim automatically
```
choco install python2
```
