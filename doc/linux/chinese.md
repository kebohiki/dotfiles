## Input method
`ibus-pinyin` should be installed by default with proper region, can use the system text entry to enable it, seems the `ibus-setup` setting is not working for now.

there is a setting of using system keyboard layout that only available though `ibus-setup`, probably need to active it for using the Dvorak layout.


## Fonts

```
sudo apt-get install fonts-noto
